# Power BI Predicting Employee Flight Risk

## Overview

This model was built using employee records, which were first enriched with an Azure Machine Learning model to predict the flight risk for each employee.

Using the Key Influencers -visual among others, employee segments can be identified for which the predicted likelihood of employees leaving are disproportionately high.

## Feature Highlights

- A Decision Tree algorithm was implemented with Azure ML Studio for predicting flight risk
